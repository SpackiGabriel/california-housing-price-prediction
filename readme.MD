## Dataset
The California housing dataset contains features related to housing prices in districts across California. Features include median income, house age, average number of rooms, average number of bedrooms, population, average house occupancy, latitude, and longitude.

## Data Preprocessing
- The dataset is loaded and converted into a pandas DataFrame.
- Features and target variable are separated.
- Data is split into training and testing sets.

## Model Training
- Linear Regression model is trained using the training data.

## Evaluation
- Mean Squared Error (MSE) is calculated between the true and predicted values.

## Visualization
- Scatter plot is generated to visualize predicted vs. actual values.
- A sample scatter plot is created to visualize a subset of the testing data.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the use of machine learning techniques, particularly Linear Regression, for predicting housing prices in California. Further improvements and exploration can be done by trying different models and tuning hyperparameters.
